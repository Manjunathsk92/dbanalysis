        test that routes can be reliably traversed using the time tables, and that they are properly aligned.
        Found a big problem here regarding route variations. Too many of the route variations will fail on a given day
        
        I don't get it. This works for quick predict, but not here. Must be something wrong in the code
        

        This is fundamentally wierd. The prediction method uses the same strategy and works. Why can't we pass this test?

        The predict method checks every single route, and fails on less than 0.05. This test fails on about 30%?

        Maybe there is no time to fix it. At least the prediction api works.
    
        The number had to be adjusted here to only go as far as the second last stop in the route. Not perfect, but not so bad either.
